## Project Objectives

Recently I began learning typeScript and I find the best way to learn is by building so I decided to build the checkers board game from scratch. This project would also require a lot of DOM manipulation, conditionals and many other core javaScript features that I could refine in the process.

<br />

## Primary Technologies

* html
* css
* typeScript 4.1.3
* webpack 5.11.1
* eslint 7.17.0
* jest 26.6.3
* @testing-library/dom 7.29.1

<br />

## Getting Started

Begin by cloning the repo to your machine and installing the app dependencies using:
```
npm install
```
Then to run the app in development, use the command:
```
npm run start
```
This will open the app for you using webpack dev server to `localhost:5500` with hot reloading enabled. To build a `dist` folder for production, run the command:
```
npm run build
```

<br />

## Running Tests

To run tests on the app using jest and testing-library use the command:
```
npm run test
```
